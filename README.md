# MCFactCord
 A bare bones - but effective - Minecraft wiki link bot that functions on keywords not commands.

Steps:
1. Set your bot token and channel ID in the mcfc.py file.
2. Modify your Keywords list to your liking.
3. Run start.bat.
4. Type a keyword in chat, and the bot will automatically detect it and all sub varieties of the keyword and return a wiki link for that entry.

Notes - If you would like to ammend this list with all possible real item names in minecraft, please feel free to submit a pull request and I will happily look over it and merge if its comprehensive enough. I just used a list generated by AI.
